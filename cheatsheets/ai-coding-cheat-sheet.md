# 🤖 AI-Powered Coding Cheat Sheet (Engineering, not "Vibing")

AI is a powerful "Co-Pilot," but you are still the **Captain**. Proper AI-powered development is about precision, context, and verification—not just "vibe coding" (blindly hitting accept).

### 1. The Context-First Rule
AI can only help you based on what it knows. Before asking a question:
- **Share the Stack**: Mention you are using Vue 3, Tailwind, or Vanilla JS.
- **Show the Error**: Copy-paste the *exact* error message from the console.
- **Provide the Goal**: "I want to center a div using Flexbox inside a 3x3 grid" is better than "Help me fix my CSS."

### 2. Prompt Engineering for Developers
Use these patterns to get better code:
- **Roleplay**: "Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer and review this code for performance."
- **Specific Tasks**: "Refactor this `fetch` call to use `async/await` and add a `try/catch` block."
- **Constraints**: "Solve this without using any external libraries, just Vanilla JavaScript."

### 3. Verification (Trust but Verify)
AI can "hallucinate" (make things up). Always check:
- **Library Versions**: Did it suggest a library that is 5 years old?
- **Security**: Did it accidentally suggest hardcoding an API key?
- **Logic**: Read the code line-by-line. If you can't explain what it does, don't use it.

### 4. Use AI for "Rubber Ducking"
Instead of asking for the answer, ask for the **Logic**:
- "Can you explain how `setInterval` works in the context of a game timer?"
- "What are the pros and cons of using Props vs Emits for this specific problem?"

### 5. AI as a Debugger
AI is great at finding typos and logic flaws.
- **Upload Snippet**: "Why is my `v-for` loop not rendering any items?"
- **Analyze Flow**: "Why is my `score.value` not updating when the button is clicked?"

> **The Golden Rule**: Use AI to accelerate your **Understanding**, not just your typing speed. If the AI writes it, you must be able to defend it!
