# Lend a Cane: Navigating the Modern Web Technology

**Finding Your Footing in Logic, Design, and Frameworks**

Welcome to the White Canes Labs developer workshop! This repository is designed to be your guide (your "cane") as you navigate the transition from a student to a developer who can ship real-world solutions.

## 🎙️ Workshop Details

- **Theme:** Modern Web Development Essentials
- **Duration:** ~4 Hours
- **Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS, Vue.js 3 (Vite)

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo is split into two main sections:

- **📂 `/starter-lab`**: The blank canvas. We will build our projects here from scratch.
- **📂 `/solution-vault`**: The "Key Answers." Use this if you get stuck or want to review the best practices after the session.
- **📂 `/cheatsheets`**: Quick reference guides for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, **AI-Powered Coding**, and our **Workshop Discussion Guide** to help you during the session.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before we begin:

- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub Account
- **Runtime:** Node.js (v18+)
- **Package Manager:** npm (included with Node)

## 🗺️ Program Roadmap

### 🏁 Phase 0: Opening Remarks

- The "Why": Moving from users to builders.
- The Architecture: Frontend, Backend, and the API bridge.
- Modern Web: Why we use Vite, SPAs, and the KISS Principle.

### 🧱 Phase 1: The Foundations

**Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game**

- **HTML + CSS:** Semantic structure and the power of `:root` variables for theming.
- **JavaScript 101:** Logic, `Math.random()`, and learning to talk to the DOM.

### 🎨 Phase 2: Design & Data

**Project: Dynamic ID Generator**

- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first design—centering divs like a pro without leaving your HTML.
- **Fetch API:** Connecting to the "Outside World" using `async/await`.

### ⚡ Phase 3: The Framework Leap

**Project: The Sound Tile Matrix**

- **The Framework War:** Why we chose Vue.js for White Canes Solutions.
- **Reactivity:** Mastering `ref()` and State Management.
- **Dynamic UI:** Using `v-for` and `:class` to build a 3x3 interactive soundboard.
